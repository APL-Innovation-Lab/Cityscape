# Cityscape Night View Interactive Sketch

This interactive sketch is designed to create a beautiful night view of a cityscape. It was developed as part of the Austin Public Library Innovation Lab project, aiming to encourage learning, experimentation, and appreciation of digital art and coding.

## About the Sketch

The sketch depicts a cityscape at night, complete with gradient skies, buildings with windows, radio and water towers. It is created using p5.js, a JavaScript library that makes coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners.

## Experimenting with the Sketch

You can experiment with this sketch by visiting the OpenProcessing site: [Cityscape Night View Sketch](https://openprocessing.org/sketch/2158911). OpenProcessing is a creative coding platform for learning and teaching how to code within the context of the visual arts. You can fork this sketch from the provided link or from the associated GitHub repository to start creating your version.

### Ways to Modify or Extend the Sketch

1. **Random Lights On/Off**: Introduce a feature to randomly turn building windows on or off to simulate the varied lighting of a real city.
2. **Interactivity**: Add interactive elements like a save button to save the current view, or a reload button to generate a new cityscape layout.
3. **Building Varieties**: Increase the diversity of buildings, introducing different architectural styles or specific landmark buildings.
4. **Bridge on the River**: Add a bridge to the river part of the sketch, enhancing the realism and complexity of the cityscape.
5. **Dynamic Sky**: Introduce changes in the sky, such as moving stars or a moon, to add more dynamism to the scene.
6. **Seasonal Themes**: Implement seasonal changes, like adding snow in winter or changing the skyline's color palette.
7. **Day/Night Toggle**: Incorporate a feature to switch between day and night views of the cityscape.
